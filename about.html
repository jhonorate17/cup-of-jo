  Hello! My name is Joel Honorate — feel free to call me Jo.  <br>
  I’m a junior at the University of North Carolina at Asheville, majoring in New Media with a minor in Computer Science.

  <br><br>

  My focus areas are 3D modeling, interactive media, and creative coding.

  <br><br>

  I’ve been in love with movies, video games, and the digital art world for as long as I can remember.  
  That love began when I first sat down at a computer as a kid in Cuba.

  <br><br>

  After graduating high school, I initially attended UNC Charlotte as a business major.  
  It felt like the expected and easy path at the time — so I followed it.  
  Very quickly, I realized I was deeply uninterested and struggling academically.

  <br><br>

  I stepped away from school, worked a blue-collar job, and spent about a year thinking seriously about what I wanted from my life.  
  Eventually, I chose to embrace the creative side of myself that I had kept tucked away — a side I was admittedly scared to bring into the light.

  <br><br>

  That decision led me to UNC Asheville, where I discovered a space that values creativity and experimentation!
