      <h1>"Sounds In Silence" Short Film</h1>
      <p>
      Here is a link to the video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0Hp_ZM1wyg"class="btn-link">CLICK ME!</a> <br><br>
This short film was created for NM281: Introduction to Video Art and Design (Fall 2025) as a final project. The assignment involved producing a personal work using the video and sound editing tools introduced in the course, primarily within the Adobe Suite, with After Effects serving as the central platform for editing and compositing.
<br><br>The project began with a formal proposal, in which I outlined a concept focused on capturing the quiet sounds of daily life—ranging from the ambient noise of the city to personal home routines. The synopsis described a transition from busy, urban environments to the subtle, overlooked sounds of home, encouraging attention to everyday auditory details. 
<br><br>Footage was captured on my phone and the phones of friends, and the final film integrates these recordings with instrumental interludes from Frank Ocean’s Blonde album. While videography is not my primary focus in New Media, the project allowed for experimentation with editing, sound layering, and narrative pacing, resulting in a work that is both technically and personally reflective.
