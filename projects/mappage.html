This project was created for NM231: Introduction to Interactive Media (Fall 2025) as a final assignment exploring environmental issues through interactive media. While most of my peers focused on AI, I chose to highlight the environment and bring in my interest in the outdoors. In the weeks leading up, I conducted research, went on hikes, and attended NEMAC and NOAA events, where I spoke with a NOAA employee about the role of maps in understanding environmental impacts. These experiences helped shape both the concept and execution of the project.
<br><br>The work combines physical and digital interactivity through a hand-crafted map of the Blue Ridge Parkway connected to a Makey Makey. Moving a digital “hiker” along the map triggers the website to display information about environmental impacts and tips for responsible hiking. The website was built in Visual Studio Code using Java, HTML, and CSS, with Leaflet serving as the mapping framework. Design choices, including the layout of the map and the ten-button limit of the Makey Makey, shaped the project, balancing ambition with feasibility while integrating research, coding, and interactive design.
<br><br>While the project could have been expanded with additional interactive points or more detailed physical elements, it demonstrates how physical interaction and digital design can work together to communicate information in an engaging way. The project reflects a hands-on approach to learning and creating, and it was highly rewarding to see the research, interface, and interactivity come together into a functional and informative experience.
