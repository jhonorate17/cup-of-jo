      <h1>Blender Course Practice: Series I</h1>
      <p>
  This is the first in a series of Blender exercises that will track my progress as I learn more advanced techniques. Moonlight served as the reference for this project, and I recommend watching it if you haven’t already.
<br><br>This project is my first exploration in Blender, completed as part of an independent study following a beginner-to-pro course. It is a recreation of a scene from the film, created to practice foundational tools. For this project, I focused exclusively on scale, rotate, and move operations, intentionally avoiding face editing or shape modeling to strengthen my understanding of spatial relationships and scene composition.
<br><br>The project involved building the scene from scratch, arranging objects, and organizing space to match the cinematic reference. This exercise helped me establish a workflow and gain confidence in basic modeling and scene setup, providing a foundation for future projects.
