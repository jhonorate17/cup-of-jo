      <h1>Blender Course Practice: Series II</h1>
      <p>
This is the second in a series of Blender exercises that track my progress as I explore more advanced techniques. For this project, I recreated a scene from Star Wars, featuring an X-wing flying toward the Death Star—a classic moment that served as both a fun and challenging reference.
<br><br>For this exercise, I began using face editing tools, which allowed me to rotate, scale, and move individual faces to construct the X-wing and the Death Star. While I have not yet explored more advanced operations like bevel, join, or face deletion, this step marked a significant expansion of my modeling capabilities and opened up new ways to approach geometry in Blender.
<br><br>Working with these tools has been both exciting and a little overwhelming, as each new function adds complexity to the workflow. Keeping the project relatively simple allowed me to focus on mastering the basics of face editing while maintaining clear structure and proportion in the models. This project builds on the skills developed in my first Blender exercise and sets the stage for incorporating more advanced techniques in future projects.
