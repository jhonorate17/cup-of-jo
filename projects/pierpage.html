      <h1>"By The Pier" Animation</h1>
      <p>
        Here is a link to the video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF0adxFTsUg"class="btn-link">CLICK ME!</a> <br><br>
This animation was created over the course of a semester for NM251002: Introduction to Motion Media (Fall 2025) and served as my final project for the course. The assignment was my first sustained experience with hand-drawn animation and motion media workflows. While drawing and character animation are not my primary focus within New Media, the project required me to engage deeply with storyboarding, timing, and iterative production.
<br><br>The film incorporates hand-drawn and stop-motion elements created in Photoshop, 3D assets modeled in Maya, and animation and compositing completed in Adobe Animate and After Effects. Narratively, the work follows a robot who raises a bird hatchling and eventually lets it go, reflecting on growth and transition over time. The final piece represents both a technical and narrative learning process developed gradually throughout the semester.
