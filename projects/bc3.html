      <h1>Blender Course Practice: Series III</h1>
      <p>
        This project continues my Blender exercise series with a room scene inspired by Jujutsu Kaisen, an anime and manga that has been a major visual influence for me. In this tutorial, I moved beyond basic object and face transforms and began working with more foundational modeling tools, including object joining, face deletion, extrusion, loop cuts, and beveling. Bevel quickly became one of my favorite tools, as it added a sense of weight and realism to otherwise rigid geometry. I also experimented with pushing beveling more aggressively for abstract forms, which I used to construct elements like the salad on the table and the laundry in the basket.
<br><br>At this stage, I am still finding organic forms, especially cloth-like shapes, challenging, as well as developing a stronger sense of proportion within a scene. Questions such as scale, wall height, and object sizing come up often, but I see these as skills that will improve naturally with continued practice and visual exposure. This project helped clarify those gaps while reinforcing the importance of observation and iteration in 3D work.
<br><br>Since this is my third project in the series, I also chose to include a snapshot of my workflow. I typically work with a reference image open alongside Blender, along with a checklist of props to keep the scene organized and manageable. I begin by establishing the room structure before layering in smaller details to give the space character. While I am still refining an efficient Blender workflow, each project has made the process feel more intuitive, and I’m looking forward to applying newly unlocked tools in future exercises.
